# WELCOME TO COME/AWAY

## Description: 
Come/Away is a React application created with the sole purpose of streamlining visiting times for the family and friends of new parents. With Come/Away, those expecting a baby are able to simplify the way they share their good news when the baby arrives. The expecting parent(s) after setting up an account will set their expected due date, a special message regarding their babies arrival, as well as optimal visiting hours. The user will then be able to share a link with their loved ones containing a form to join a mailing list. Upon babies arrival, the parent will share their announcement email which will also contain a link directing recipients to a calendar to select a time they plan to visit.
